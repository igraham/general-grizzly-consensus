= 1. 0 Introduction =
This section provides an overview of the entire requirement document. This document describes all data, functional and behavioral requirements for software.
Ex. The section introduces the system requirements specification (SRS) for the Global Personal Marketplace (GPM) system to its readers.
Ex. The Global Personal Marketplace (GPM) system will be a global Web-based marketplace bringing together private individuals and small companies to buy and sell all manner of items.
Our goal is to successfully create an application for staff and student. We also aim to develop a project in such a way that allows for the addition of student users in future
Contact information/ SRS team members: Our contacts throughout the project will be Dr. Robert Lutz and Dr. Evelyn Brannock of Georgia Gwinnett College.   
The team members for the duration of the project are as follow:
  * Rachael Wright
  * Stephen Kent
  * Burley Mullins
  * Turab Babar
  * Marcus Michalske
  * Ian Graham

== 1.1 Goals and objectives ==
The main goal of GGC2 is to establish a program for ITEC 1001 teachers and students
Overall goals and software objectives are described.

= 1.2 Statement of scope =
A description of the software is presented. Major inputs, processing functionality and outputs are described without regard to implementation detail.
Inputs:
4 text boxes: IP address for students
Radio buttons: “True/ False” and “Multiple Choice”
Radio Buttons: Question Answers
Drop-down Box: number of multiple choice questions
Send Button
Connect Button
Send New Question Button
Outputs:
Graph of student scores
Text of connected students, and students that have responded
Instructions text one student applet

== 1.3 Software context ==
The software is placed in a business or product line context. Strategic issues relevant to context are discussed. The intent is for the reader to understand the 'big picture'.
Flavor Text - A teacher opens an instance of... the teacher then opens the graph and briefly examines student results

== 1.4 Major constraints ==
Any business or product line constraints that will impact the manner in which the software is to be specified, designed, implemented or tested are noted here.
The project will not be tested in an actual classroom because space is limited.
