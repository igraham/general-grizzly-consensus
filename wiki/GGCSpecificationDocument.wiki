= 1. 0 Introduction =
The General Grizzly Consensus is a program that allows both professor and student to interact by means of a completely anonymous poll of answers to be used with a third party program to display questions. I.E. Microsoft Word, PowerPoint, website, and or text editor.

Contact information/ SRS team members: Our contacts throughout the project will be Dr. Robert Lutz and Dr. Evelyn Brannock of Georgia Gwinnett College.   
The team members for the duration of the project are as follow:
  * Rachael Wright (Project Leader)
  * Stephen Kent (Network)
  * Burley Mullins (QA and Testing)
  * Turab Babar (Analyst)
  * Marcus Michalske (UI Development)
  * Ian Graham (Code Development)

== 1.1 Goals and objectives ==
Our goal is to successfully create an application for staff and student of GGC with little to no digital footprint. We also aim to develop a project in such a way that allows for the addition of student users in future classes the ability to build on what is currently The General Grizzly Consensus.

= 1.2 Statement of scope =
A description of the software is presented. Major inputs, processing functionality and outputs are described without regard to implementation detail.

Inputs:
4 JFormattedText boxes: IP address for students to connect to.
JToggleButton Student buttons: “True/ False” and “Multiple Choice”
JToggleButton Professor buttons: Question Answers
JComboBox Drop-down Box: Multiple choice questions
JButton Student Buttons: Send Anwser, Connect, Exit
JButton Professor Buttons: Send Question, Hide/Show, Exit

Outputs:
Graph of student responses
Text of connected students, and students that have responded
Professor IP Address

== 1.3 Software context ==
The software is placed in a business or product line context. Strategic issues relevant to context are discussed. The intent is for the reader to understand the 'big picture'.
Flavor Text - A teacher opens an instance of... the teacher then opens the graph and briefly examines student results

== 1.4 Major constraints ==
Any business or product line constraints that will impact the manner in which the software is to be specified, designed, implemented or tested are noted here.
The project will not be tested in an actual classroom because space is limited.

= 2.0 Usage scenario =
This section provides a usage scenario for the software. It organized information collected during requirements elicitation into use-cases.

== 2.1 User profiles ==
The profiles of all user categories are described here.
Teacher: Send questions/ Show hidegraph
Student: Connect to teacher/ Answer Questions
