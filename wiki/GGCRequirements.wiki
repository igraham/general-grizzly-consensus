= Customer Requirements =

The following are user requirements or stories for each of the issues and enhancement requests in the backlog.


== Issue 6: Display application's version - Green group ==

6.1 As an instructor, I want to see the application's version number from within the application so I can ensure I'm using the latest version or provide the information to someone who is supporting me.

6.2  As a student, I want to see the application's version number from within the application so I can provide it to the instructor when asked.

6.3 As an instructor or support staff, I want the version number of the application to be clear and easy to find so anyone using the application can determine the version quickly.

== Issue 21: Add support for a countdown timer - Green group ==

21.1 As an instructor, I want to limit the amount of time students have to respond to a question so it's clear when results can be revealed and I can move on.

21.2 As an instructor, I want students to be able to see how much time is remaining on an open question so they are encouraged to provide an answer quickly.

21.2 As an instructor, I want it to be an option to apply a time limit to questions so I don't have to limit every question.

21.3 As an instructor, I want an option to hide the displayed timer so I can use it as a reference for myself and not distract students with the time limit.

21.4 As an instructor, I want the most common amount of time (30 seconds) to appear by default so I don't have to enter a value every time.

21.5 As an instructor, I want to be able to use any amount of time, in one-second increments, as the question duration so I can be precise about how long students are allowed to answer.

21.6 As an instructor, I want students to still be able to respond when the timer expires, but not after I choose to close a question, so I can make exceptions to allow for more time.

21.7 As an instructor, I want to be able to use the timer feature with a minimal number of additional steps or clicks, so I can present a series of questions to the class without delay.

21.8 As a student, I want to be able to clearly see the amount of time remaining on a question so I can prepare and submit my answer in time.

== Issue 26: Font sizes and colors don't display well - Green group ==

26.1 As an instructor, I want all text within my application and the student's application to be easy to read so mistakes aren't made and delays aren't caused.

26.2 As a student, I want all text within in the instructor's application to be easy to read so I don't miss an questions or details displayed on the screen while I'm sitting in the back of the room.

26.3 As a student, I want it to be clear when I've made my selection and submission so I don't mistakenly re-submit it or assume it wasn't submitted.

26.4 As an instructor, I want it to be visually clear when buttons have been pressed or options selected so I don't cause delays while trying to determine my selections.

26.5 As an instructor, I want the visual design of the application to be displayed properly on both a Mac and Windows machine so it is consistent and so layout problems don't lead to confusion.

== Issue 36: Feedback when user waiting for initial question - Green group ==

36.1 As an instructor, I want it to be clear to students when they are connected to my session, but simply waiting for the first question to be opened, so they are not wondering if it is functioning properly.

== Issue 39: User Cursor Position - Green group ==

39.1 As a student, I want focus to be in the IP address field when I launch the app so I don't have to make an extra click before entering the IP address.
